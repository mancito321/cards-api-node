# Project on MTG cards personal API
## Purpose 
As a way to learn and practice some technogies as docker and koa for Node, I created this repository. Merging development and magic cards I could make something and learn on the way.

### Logic
Learning KOA js as the main api framework and with mongo DB and the scryfall library for node I was able to make this basic library, where I can search for card or card tye and store basic info on My mongo db. This is just the first part of what I currently have on mind for this project.
It is a fun experience and a good practice.
